Part I: Modifications made
=================
* In order to make the HTML documents look "old", some changes were made. In my gutenberg.css file...
  * The body was changed to give it a an old, yellowish background
  * The font of the paragraphs were changed to Garamond (serif) as the first font choice
  * Headers (e.g. Chapter #), were bolded
  * Image captions (if they exist) were usually italicized
  * White backgrounds (if they exist) were removed from images
  * Anchor tags were changed such that they would blend in, rather than appear as blue
